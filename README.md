# Riboxyme

## Description:  
* When creating a git repository, one of the first tasks is to develop a readme file that covers the scope and usage of the applicaiton.
* By using the Riboxyme README.MD generator app, a user will be able to answer a few questions within the terminal of VScode to quickly outline the project with a presentable document.
* With standard methods of development, github push/pull, VScode, npm install, the user will run thru focusing prompts that result in the creation of a concise markdown file.
* To get going on your project, consider using this readme.md generator as a warm up exercise to quickly develope your application to a deployable status.
